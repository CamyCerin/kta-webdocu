# Les catacombes, la face cach√©e de Paris

<img src="screenshot.png" alt="capture ecran du site kta-webdocu">

## Project description

There is a part of our Parisian heritage which is quite secret and intrigues everyone: The catacombs.
Unfortunately, this place is very secret (the Ktaphiles don't like to give too much information to avoid too many intrusions in this place which is sacred to them). The is only an official part, in the form of a museum, that is accessible by all. Well, not exactly, because all the people who are claustrophobic or who just don't live in Paris and don't go there, can't access it.
How about we change that?
Let us change thsi by taking you on a guided tour 30 meters underground. You won't have to crawl in the cat flaps, walk in the water or risk slipping in the mud.
We invite you to discover the history of the catacombs, the role they have played in the history of France, their anecdotes and rituals through a documented, fun and interactive visit.
